## Overview
The overall objective of our project is to design, implement, and evaluate a learning-based navigation policy that can guide an autonomous agent through 2D obstacle environments. 

We will build
gridworld environments to train and compare several RL agents (Q-learning, DQN, and PPO). 

We evaluate them based on reward functions and analyze how reward
shaping and hyperparameter choices influence stability, sample efficiency, and learned behavior.
